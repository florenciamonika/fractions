Simple application that given a number of rupiahs will calculate the minimum number of rupiahs needed to make that amount :
<ul>
  <li>15000 = 1 x Rp10000, 1x Rp5000</li>
  <li>Rp3900 = 1x Rp2000, 1x Rp1000, 1x Rp500, 4x Rp100</li>
  <li>12510 = 1 x Rp10000, 1x Rp2000, 1x Rp500, left Rp10 (no available fraction)</li>
</ul>
